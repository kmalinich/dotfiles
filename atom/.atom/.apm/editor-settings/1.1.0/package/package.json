Type `Editor Settings: Open Grammar Config`\nand press ⏎.\n\nA new `.cson` file for the grammar of the file you had open should show with the current\neditor settings for the given grammar. Edit it and save.\n\nThe language/grammar settings files are saved in the `grammar-config` directory located\nin the main Atom configuration directory with a lower-case file name format.\n\nFor example, the config file for CoffeeScript would be `coffeescript.cson`.\n\n### Local configuration\n\nFor a per directory based configuration, you can create a `.editor-settings` file in the\nconcerned directories.\n\n### Supported settings\n\nThe API for setting editor settings currently only supports:\n\n- Tab length (tabLength)\n- Soft/hard tabs (softTabs)\n- Soft wrap (softWrap)\n- Encoding (encoding)\n- Atom and Syntax theme (themes)\n\n### Example configuration\n\nThe following example is for CoffeeScript, it sets the tab length to `2`, but if\nthe file extension is `.cson` it sets it to `4`.\n\n    tabLength: 2\n    extensionConfig:\n      cson:\n        tabLength: 4\n\n#### Experimental settings:\n\n    fontFamily: 'Source Code Pro'\n    grammarConfig:\n      'GitHub Markdown':\n        fontFamily: 'monospace'\n\n\n#### Example project and directory configuration\n\nAll options not nested under a specific grammar are used for all grammar and extensions.\n\n    tabLength: 2\n    themes: ['atom-light-ui', 'atom-light-syntax']\n    grammarConfig:\n      'PHP':\n        tabLength: 4\n        softTabs: true\n        extensionConfig:\n          phtml:\n            softTabs: false\n\n## Features\n\n- Per-language support\n- Per-file extension support\n- Per-project support\n- Per-directory support\n\n### Planned\n\n- Change configuration directory\n\nIf there is a feature you'd like added simply create an issue or fork and implement it and send a pull request.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/nirix/atom-editor-settings/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/nirix/atom-editor-settings#readme","_id":"editor-settings@1.1.0","_shasum":"e97122bb1bd1bfd272ec83f5370c1a087308a8ed","_resolved":"file:../d-116830-1272-1y03vgg/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116830-1272-1y03vgg/package.tgz"}
